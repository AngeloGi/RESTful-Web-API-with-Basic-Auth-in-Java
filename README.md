# RESTful-Web-API-with-Basic-Auth-in-Java
A basic implementation of a Java JAX-RS REST API design, Constructed for Eclipse on a Java EE, it makes use of JPA (ORM Hibernate), MySQL, Maven Jersey Servlet template. Tested on Glassfish 5.0.

I created this in February of 2019, in an effort to set a concrete foundation of implementing JAVA JAX-RS RESTful APIs.

I decided to share on GitHub, so anyone can try it out and perhaps learn something new.
